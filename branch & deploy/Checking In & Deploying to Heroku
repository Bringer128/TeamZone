Code is stored remotely in github
Code is also deployed to heroku which also uses git 

The heroku toolbet is already installed in cloud 9.  If using another platform then installing this is useful

Loggin into heroku is via heroku login  

Heroku apps should exist already - but if a new app is required use the heroku create command

In first time environmets a public key is required.  use 'ssh-keygen -t rsa'

If keys exists then use heroku keys:add to sync it up

To list apps use heroku apps e.g. 

teamzone@teamzone:~/workspace (master) $ heroku apps
=== My Apps
teamzone-dev
teamzone-load-ui (eu)

Adding remotes is via something like this example:

git remote add teamzone-load-ui git@heroku.com:teamzone-load-ui.git

To add a git remote to heroku use for example: heroku git:remote -a teamzone-load-ui
The last item in the command line is the name of the git repo

Checking in is via git command line e.g. 

git commit . -m 'checking the missing views'

and then push to github via

git push origin master   

where origin is the name of the github remote and master is the repo on github.com

a deployment to heroku is achieved through git, e.g. 

git push teamzone-dev master

this pushes to teamzone-dev
