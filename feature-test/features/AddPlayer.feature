Feature:  Add a Player
To be able to contact our players, as a coach Iâ€™d like to add player names and address details into the system

Background:

	Given we have a team called Western Knights 1st Team for the season 2014 with no players listed playing in the city of Perth
	
Scenario: The player vital details need to be entered

	Given I have an empty Player List
	when I enter vital details [firstname], [surname], [dob], [address], [suburb], [postcode], [phone], [email] 
	then The player list should have 1 player listed

Where:
	 firstname	| surname	| dob			| address									| suburb			| postcode 		| phone			| email

Scenario: Repeating the same player details for an already exisiting player should be disallowed

	Given I have a Player List with the following details [firstname], [surname], [dob], [address], [suburb], [postcode], [phone], [email]
	when I enter those details again 
	then saving should not be permitted and the user notified	 

Where:

	Given As a coach 
	when I attempt to enter the following details which contains an incorrect date [firstname], [surname], [dob], [address], [suburb], [postcode], [phone], [email]
	then I should be notified of an invalid date
	and the player should not be in the database

Where:
